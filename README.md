# Solar Energy Forecasting Project

This project is designed to forecast solar energy production for Bapco Energies system using weather data and machine learning models. It consists of a backend server written in Go and a frontend application built with Next.js.

## Project Overview

The Solar Energy Forecasting Project aims to provide accurate predictions of solar energy generation based on historical weather data. The backend processes data and runs machine learning models, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface to visualize the results.

## Features

- **Backend**: 
  - Data processing and storage
  - Machine learning model execution
  - API endpoints for data retrieval

- **Frontend**:
  - Interactive data visualization
  - User-friendly interface for exploring forecasts

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Go, SQLite, Python (for machine learning models)
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure Go is installed on your system. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3 is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Running the Project

You can run both the backend and frontend using the provided script:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

This will start the backend server and the frontend application concurrently.
